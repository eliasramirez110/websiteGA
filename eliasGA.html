         Hi all at General Assembly and thank you for giving me the opportunity to apply for the software engineer immersive program.
         </br>
         I am very excited for this opportunity, and I hope I will get accepted. I am ready to work hard and do whatever it takes to become a software engineer. This website is simple, but with the skills I will learn at GA, it will someday become
         flashy!

         Here are some Q&A's about me that I think you might find interesting.
        <ul>
        <li><b>A time I solved a problem at work.</b> <br/>
         In one of my previous jobs I worked as a junior buyer for Restaurant Depot. If you've never heard of Restaurant Depot, you can think of it as a Costco but for restaurants. My role there primarily consisted of creating purchase orders, and
         arranging for those orders to be fulfilled by Restaurant Depot's vendors for my department. At one point, management decided that the creation of purchase orders on the system we had at the time, was taking too much time and the process was
         inefficient. To solve this issue management implemented a new system to create purchase orders which required the use of Microsoft Excel's visual basic to create a program that allowed us to script the purchase orders using the program that
         was created. Many of my coworkers were senior buyers and were already accustomed to the previous way of creating purchase orders, thus they resisted the change. In addition, many of them did not have the skill level in using Excel to be able
         to use the scripting program that was created to automate the process of creating purchase orders. I was one of the people tasked with teaching those who struggled with the new system how to use it. At first, I thought it would be an easy
         task. I quickly realized that the task was much more difficult than I anticipated because I had to teach many of my coworkers the fundamentals of Excel before I could move on to more complicated things like running visual basic application
         programs. Instead of getting frustrated, I decided that I would be committed to the task of teaching my fellow coworkers what they needed to learn, and I would do it to the best of my ability. As a result, I was instrumental in the success
         of the department, and soon all the buyers were comfortable with using the program.
       </li>

       <li>
         <b>My tech background</b> <br/>
         My technological background consist of using Microsoft suite (Excel, PowerPoint, Word) at a professional level. As far as software engineering goes, I know HTML/CSS, I know of Bootstrap for CSS (not really how to use it), and I am familiar with the
         command line. I am currently teaching myself JavaScript and jQuery. My learning of HTML and CSS was also a result of self study.
       </li>

       <li>
         <b>Events led me to decide that I want to be a software engineer.</b>
         <br/>
         I could probably write an entire book to answer this question. Becoming a software engineer was always in my mind ever since I learned it was a career option, back when I was in my early 20s. Growing up I wasn't encouraged to explore career
         options that were not considered "safe" so I ended up going to college and studied accounting. I worked in accounting jobs, as well as a bank, and as a buyer at Restaurant Depot. While these jobs did provide an average income, I was never
         happy and I wanted more. As a part time role, I worked as a personal trainer because one of my biggest passions is health and fitness. When I would train my clients, I was so happy because I got the opportunity to motivate them and change
         their lives. The problem with personal training is, the money isn't always great and it can be a very unstable business. When Covid hit last year, gyms were shut down and my personal training business suffered as a result. I was devastated,
         and for a while lost and depressed. But in the midst of that, thats when I decided it was time to pursue that dream I always had of becoming a software engineer. I figured with all the extra time I had from being out of work, might as well
         learn code. I reached out to a close friend of mine who is a software engineer. I visited him in his home in Tampa and he shared his story with me in full detail. As it turned out he was mostly self taught! For me it was a "if he can do it,
         I can too" kind of a moment. I was filled with motivation and confidence after that conversation which was back in November of 2020, and I haven't looked back since. I've been self learning since that time, but I realized that I would
         benefit greatly from doing a program like this, and that's what has brought me to apply for GA.

         <b>Why do I think I will be a good engineer?</b> <br/>
         I think I would be a good engineer because I want to be an engineer. I know that I'm intelligent and capable; but most people are intelligent and capable. If you want something, you could make it happen no matter what.
         In my own experience of learning code I've realized that learning to code requires patience, persistence, and disciple. I think I have what it takes to become a great engineer and build incredible software.
